!!!! IMPORTANT !!!! 

ALL RECIPES MUST BE INSIDE THE RECIPES FOLDER AND HAVE THERE OWN .JSON

Easiest route would be to just copy and paste my exampleRecipe and rename the file to whatever you'd like, as long as it is a json and follows the below format. File name, and _id do not matter.


{
  "_id": "CHR_Recipe_01", --- Can be whatever you choose, just make sure that you change this for EVERY recipe. EXAMPLE: CHR_Recipe_02

  "areaType": 6, --- Where the craft will be done, reference supplied list below

  "requiredLevel": 1,--- Required station level

  "productionTime": 60, --- Production time in seconds

  "endProduct": "5c94bbff86f7747ee735c08f", --- Item you will recieve once craft is complete.

  "count": 1, --- How many of the item you will get

  "needFuelForAllProductionTime": true, --- Does it require constant fuel for crafting?   true == yes false == no

  "inputs": [ 
    { "tpl": "5755356824597772cb798962", "count": 1 }, --- Items needed for craft, follow format to add additional items. Get item ID's from here https://db.sp-tarkov.com/search
    { "tpl": "544fb45d4bdc2dee738b4568", "count": 1 }
  ],
  "tools": [
    { "tpl": "590c2d8786f774245b1f03f3", "count": 1 } --- "Tools" required for crafting. Delete the entire "tools" array. For an example please check exampleRecipe_02
  ]
}









Use some of these use at your own...risk? I haven't tested ones that do not contain vanilla recipes.
